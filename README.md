## 7. Mitigation Guide
**! IMPORTANT !** Exploits are continously developed. Aways make sure to work with the **latest** version of scanners. It is verified that scanners used below take into account that version **2.17.1** of log4j is recommended. 

1. Identify potential vulnerable devices by using https://github.com/NCSC-NL/log4shell/blob/main/software/README.md - This a time consuming task, but you need to do it anyway, so better start quickly!

2. Run a scan to check for vulnerable java applications/dependancies using: https://github.com/dtact/divd-2021-00038--log4j-scanner with command `divd-2021-00038--log4j-scanner.exe {target-path}` and watch for files that have been classified as vulnerable.

| Version  | Classification |
| -------- | -------------- |
| 2.12.4   | Safe           |
| 2.17.1   | Safe           |
| 2.3.2    | Safe
| 2.16.0   | Okay           |
| 2.15.0   | Okay           |
| < 2.15.0 | Vulnerable     |

3. Run a scan to check for expoit attempts using https://github.com/Neo23x0/log4shell-detector `python3 log4shell-detector.py -p c:\` and watch for exploitation attempts.
